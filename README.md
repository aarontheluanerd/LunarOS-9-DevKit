This is a DevKit for creating/developing programs in **LunarOS 9** (A Roblox-Based OS), this repo contains the DevKit itself and a special edition of **LunarOS** for development usage.

The DevKit contains comments documenting all functions you're allowed to use with **LunarOS**.

### Important Info About Redistribution!

Please do not redistribute the provided Developer Edition of **LunarOS** as standalone.
It is only provided so third-party developers can test their programs without I having to implement them into the [main project](https://www.roblox.com/games/11126208593/) directly.

**If you have your program ready and want to see it implemented into the main project**
Don't hesitate to send me a DM in discord! I'll happily review your program and implement it into the game if it's approved!

### Requirements for approval *or something*

1. No hidden malicious code against the game itself (malicious code **against the OS itself is** allowed.)
2. No Over-usage of external libraries/events (mostly in game.ReplicatedStorage)
3. Appropiate content that follows Roblox's TOS (of course)
4. Correct usage of LunarOS's APIs
5. Be a cool app *or something*
